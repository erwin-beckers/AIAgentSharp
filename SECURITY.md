## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in AIAgentSharp, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not Create a Public Issue**

Please **do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could potentially expose the vulnerability to malicious actors.

### 3. **What to Expect**

- You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
- We will investigate the report and provide updates
- Once confirmed, we will work on a fix
- We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### 4. **Responsible Disclosure**

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix is available
- We will work with you to coordinate the disclosure timeline
- We will credit you for discovering the vulnerability (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We will provide a timeline for when the fix will be available

### 6. **Security Features**

AIAgentSharp includes several security features:
